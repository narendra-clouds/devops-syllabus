# 🚀 What is Jenkins?

## 📌 Introduction

Jenkins is an open-source automation server used to automate software development processes such as building, testing, and deploying applications.

It plays a central role in implementing Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) practices.

---

## 🔄 Why Automation is Important

In traditional development:

- Developers write code
- Manually build the application
- Manually test
- Manually deploy

This process is slow, error-prone, and not scalable.

Jenkins automates these steps.

## ⚙️ What Jenkins Does

Jenkins can:

- Pull source code from Git repositories
- Build applications
- Run automated tests
- Generate reports
- Deploy applications
- Trigger pipelines automatically

---

## 🧠 Simple Definition

Jenkins is a tool that automatically builds, tests, and deploys applications whenever code changes occur.

---

## 🔁 How Jenkins Works (Basic Flow)

1. Developer pushes code to GitHub
2. Jenkins detects the change
3. Jenkins pulls the latest code
4. Build process runs
5. Tests execute
6. Deployment happens (optional)

---

## 🏗 Key Features

- Open-source and free
- Large plugin ecosystem
- Supports pipelines as code
- Integrates with Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, and more
- Extensible and customizable

---

## 🛠 Real-World Use Case

Example:

Whenever a developer pushes code:

- Jenkins automatically builds a Docker image
- Pushes it to Docker Hub
- Deploys it to a Kubernetes cluster

No manual intervention required.

---

## 📌 Summary

Jenkins is the backbone of CI/CD pipelines and helps teams automate repetitive tasks, improve efficiency, and reduce human errors.
