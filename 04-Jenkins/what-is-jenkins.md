# 🚀 What is Jenkins?

## 📖 Introduction

Jenkins is an open-source automation tool used to automate tasks in software development.

It helps developers automatically build, test, and deploy applications.

Instead of doing everything manually, Jenkins does it for you.

---

## 🤔 Why Do We Need Jenkins?

Imagine this situation:

- A developer writes code
- Pushes it to GitHub
- Someone has to manually download the code
- Manually build the application
- Manually test it
- Manually deploy it

This process:
- Takes time
- Causes human errors
- Is not efficient

Jenkins solves this problem by automating the entire process.

---

## 🔄 What Does Jenkins Automate?

Jenkins can automatically:

- Pull code from Git repositories (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
- Build the application
- Run automated tests
- Generate build reports
- Deploy applications to servers
- Trigger pipelines after code changes

---

## ⚙️ Where is Jenkins Used?

Jenkins is mainly used in:

- Continuous Integration (CI)
- Continuous Delivery (CD)
- DevOps pipelines
- Automated testing environments

---

## 🏗 How Jenkins Works (Basic Flow)

1. Developer pushes code to GitHub.
2. Jenkins detects the change.
3. Jenkins pulls the latest code.
4. Jenkins builds the application.
5. Jenkins runs tests.
6. Jenkins deploys the application (if configured).

Everything happens automatically.

## 🔌 Jenkins Plugins

Jenkins has thousands of plugins.

Plugins allow Jenkins to integrate with:

- Docker
- Kubernetes
- AWS
- GitHub
- Maven
- Terraform
- And many more tools

This makes Jenkins very powerful and flexible.

---

## 🌍 Real-World Example

Example scenario:

Whenever code is pushed:

- Jenkins builds a Docker image
- Pushes the image to Docker Hub
- Deploys it to a Kubernetes cluster

All without manual work.

---

## 📌 Summary

Jenkins is an automation server that helps teams:

- Save time
- Reduce human errors
- Improve software quality
- Deliver applications faster

It is one of the most important tools in DevOps.
